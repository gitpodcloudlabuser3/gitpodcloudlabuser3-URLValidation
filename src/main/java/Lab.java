     * Valid URLs will follow the pattern https://website.extension, potentially with path parameters such as
     * https://website.extension/path, and potentially with a query param such as
     * https://website.extension/path?var=abc, or multiple query params, such as
     * https://website.extension/path?var1=abc&var2=xyz
     *
     * A URL should always start with its protocol, https://
     * A URL must have any extension (such as .com)
     * The URL path should follow the extension, defined by a single slash /
     * The query parameters follow the path, defined by a question mark ?
     *
     * Tip: some string methods, such as split, will parse regex. "." and "?" are technically regex
     * statements, but you can break out of regex in those cases using "\\." and "\\?"
